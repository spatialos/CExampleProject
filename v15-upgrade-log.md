# Upgrade log for SpatialOS 15.0.0

This log provides the list of changes made to this project to upgrade it from
SpatialOS 14.9.0 to SpatialOS 15.0.0. You can follow a similar sequence of steps
to upgrade your project.

We will first migrate away from any deprecated functionality that we can on
14.9.0. This step very much depends on what functionality a project uses, and
whether or not you have already made similar changes when APIs got deprecated.
